- add bottom primary and secondary menu for js-disabled && < 480px screen in before_footer hook.
- deprecate shell_mobile_menu function
- add mobile shell_mobile_menu_primary and secondary with links to bottom navigation.
- change div to nav in all menus, keep div in sidebar
- change hybrid_*_class to hybrid_*_attributes 
- loop_nav also using "nav" and not "div"
- use "header" instead of "div" in loop-meta
  http://html5doctor.com/the-header-element/
- in singular wrap entry_title and byline in `<header="entry-header"></header>`
- new action hook; open_entry_header, close_entry_header in singular content.
- comments.php using <section>
- add inline docs in all hooks and functions in template files, just like oenology theme by chip bennet
  @link: http://www.chipbennett.net/themes/oenology/
  this inline docs is not for php doc block parser, but more for readability of the code.
  this is for easier development. and part of the goals for hybrid core 2.0 and the future
  Making it easy for new theme authors to learn from our code.
  http://themehybrid.com/support/topic/hybrid-core-20-and-the-future
- add readme file in all "atomic folders"

01 NOVEMBER 2013
========================
- fix sub-menu toggle.
- to be consistent, use top:-999em instead of display: none;
- use endash in sub-menu sub-menu lists, because the code is "2013/" = this year! :)
- remove menu-bottom via javascript: js/shell-menu.js
- fix primary secondary menu width in tablet.
- fix style loader to be in priority 11, for easier child theme filter.
- remove theme layout metabox in settings.
- add "content" class in 1c editor style, to make sure it's only for content area.
- still not sure about the editor-syle.css
- post attributes in 404 pages.
- remove loop-nav.php
- change "archive type" pages context to "_list_view" (with underscore)

- 


Temp To-Do:
- test new shell atomic template
- minify js/shell.js
- create child theme "shell-max" and "shell-min"
- all template inline docs (now only header.php)
- change all php "if" from using ":" to bracket "{}"

Maybe to-do:
- replace all template function in hybrid core to shell. => check list of hybrid core templates functions
  just create a wrapper for now.
- use simple action and filter (no atomic) (???)
- add template functions in includes, to make sure everything works.
  this is only functions can be used by child theme,
  other functions, child theme author need to make their own function.
- loop meta title and loop meta description will be using hc.2.0 functions.
